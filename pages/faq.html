						<div id="mergedmining"><strong>Is merged mining a scam, how can I mine two coins at the same time?</strong></div>
						No. Merged mining, or alternative proof of work, is a concept that has been baked into CN coins since the original byte coin days. This concept is evident in numerous other algorithms for other coins. The basic idea of how merged mining works is as follows. You send us a block of hashes, we will call it a basket of hashes for now, with a tag on the handle that says a coin name. The coin you are mining takes a look at it and says "yup that's for me has a tag on it right there", it looks at all those hashes and if the one it wants at that time is in there we win a block. We also take that same basket, and we duplicate it with a different tag on the handle then we hand it off to a second coin who also looks through it for the correct hash and if it's in there we win a block. This duplication and handing off of baskets of hashes is currently limited to two, but the future is an amazing place and some day we think you will see pools mining entire chains of coins all with the same basket of hashes being passed from coin to coin.<br><br>
						<div id="trust"><strong>I don't trust you this merged mining can't be real?</strong></div>
						Fair enough, we don't trust you either thats why we put all sorts of code into our pool to prevent duplicate hashes, and other shenanigans. Merged mining is safe as the pool that operates it. We here at Llama & Horse Mining Co. have been around the scene for quite some time, we don't make any money doing what we do, and we don't care if we ever do. We started this to learn new skills, and meet new people. We just happened to pick the world of crypto as our platform to learn on. So we really are not out to rip you off, steal a few bucks in shit coin, or whatever else you might think... But seriously don't trust us, don't trust anyone, be safe out there there are tons of scams and shady actors out there.<br><br>		
						<div id="minimumpayment"><strong>What is Minimum Payment?</strong></div>
						Minimum payment is just what it implies. The minimum amount our pool will pay out to any miner. Once a miner has reached a pool balance above this amount and the payments timeout is up the full balance will be sent. We set a minimum payment to prevent smaller miners from paying all their balance in network transfer fees. <br><br>
						<div id="forcedpayout"><strong>Can you send me the balance that is under the minimum payment amount?</strong></div>
						No. Why? Because this would require significant time on our part to do. We have to collect information from you, verify that information, modify the database so you don't start mining again and get double paid, and then manually send a transaction. Our time is super limited as we are devoted to development currently, and we have real world jobs, families, friends we like to spend time with as well. <br><br>
						<div id="paymentinterval"><strong>What is a payment interval?</strong></div>
						This is how often the script that makes payments runs. If your balance is above the minimum payment when this interval is up it will send you your full balance. <br><br>
						<div id="avgtime"><strong>What is average time?</strong></div>
						This is how long it should take our pool to find a block. This is just a suggestion and the time it takes to find a actual block could be significantly less or more than this number. <br><br>
						<div id="currenteffort"><strong>What is current effort?</strong></div>
						Based upon the average time it takes us to find a block this is how far along we are in that timeframe as a percentage. Anything less than 100% is desirable and over that is less so. <br><br>
						<div id="maturityreq"><strong>What is maturity requirment?</strong></div>
						This is the number of blocks the network takes to verify a new block, or a transaction. Once our pool finds a block it will count down the number of blocks required to verify that this block does indeed belong to our pool. After this "maturity requirement" is up we distribute the block reward as a percentage of shares sent during that block round to the miners who sent them. <br><br>
