						<div id="mergedmining"><strong>Is merged mining a scam, how can I mine two coins at the same time?</strong></div>
						No. Merged mining, or alternative proof of work, is a concept that has been baked into CN coins since the original byte coin days. This concept is evident in numerous other algorithms for other coins. The basic idea of how merged mining works is as follows. You send us a block of hashes, we will call it a basket of hashes for now, with a tag on the handle that says a coin name. The coin you are mining takes a look at it and says "yup that's for me has a tag on it right there", it looks at all those hashes and if the one it wants at that time is in there we win a block. We also take that same basket, and we duplicate it with a different tag on the handle then we hand it off to a second coin who also looks through it for the correct hash and if it's in there we win a block. This duplication and handing off of baskets of hashes is currently limited to two, but the future is an amazing place and some day we think you will see pools mining entire chains of coins all with the same basket of hashes being passed from coin to coin.<br><br>
						<div id="trust"><strong>I don't trust you this merged mining can't be real?</strong></div>
						Fair enough, we don't trust you either thats why we put all sorts of code into our pool to prevent duplicate hashes, and other shenanigans. Merged mining is safe as the pool that operates it. We here at Llama & Horse Mining Co. have been around the scene for quite some time, we don't make any money doing what we do, and we don't care if we ever do. We started this to learn new skills, and meet new people. We just happened to pick the world of crypto as our platform to learn on. So we really are not out to rip you off, steal a few bucks in shit coin, or whatever else you might think... But seriously don't trust us, don't trust anyone, be safe out there there are tons of scams and shady actors out there.<br><br>
						<div id="miningforhours"><strong>I've been mining for a hour and haven't been paid?</strong></div>
						Payments depend on quite a few things. First the pool has to find a block, second that block has to meet the maturity requirements of the network to unlock it, and third your balance has to meet the minimum payment threshold of the pool. All of these things must happen before you will get a payment sent out to your wallet. Depending on the size of the network, size of the pool, and the reward amount per block this can range from anywhere between a few minutes to a few days. Obviously if you think something is seriously wrong get ahold of us, but waiting for a little longer isn't the worst idea either.<br><br>	
						<div id="minimumpayment"><strong>What is Minimum Payment?</strong></div>
						Minimum payment is just what it implies. The minimum amount our pool will pay out to any miner. Once a miner has reached a pool balance above this amount and the payments timeout is up the full balance will be sent. We set a minimum payment to prevent smaller miners from paying all their balance in network transfer fees. <br><br>
						<div id="forcedpayout"><strong>Can you send me the balance that is under the minimum payment amount?</strong></div>
						No. Why? Because this would require significant time on our part to do. We have to collect information from you, verify that information, modify the database so you don't start mining again and get double paid, and then manually send a transaction. Our time is super limited as we are devoted to development currently, and we have real world jobs, families, friends we like to spend time with as well. <br><br>
						<div id="jceminer"><strong>JCE/CC miner keeps getting banned?</strong></div>
						Yup, and it always will. We do not support JCE or CC miner because they are closed source, and it sends duplicate or false shares to the pool in an attempt to fake a higher hash rate. We do not think it's fair to other miners if we allow some miners to fake their hash rates while others use legitimate software that doesn't. So yes it might appear that you get a higher hash rate from JCE or CC but you are not actually getting a better hash rate you are just sending shit to the pool that we have to then parse out as shit, and as such we just issue a ban for garbage shares so we don't waste resources on it. We suggest you use something like XMrig or stak that are open source and doesn't try any bullshit to fake a hash rate.<br><br>
						<div id="paymentinterval"><strong>What is a payment interval?</strong></div>
						This is how often the script that makes payments runs. If your balance is above the minimum payment when this interval is up it will send you your full balance. <br><br>
						<div id="avgtime"><strong>What is average time?</strong></div>
						This is how long it should take our pool to find a block. This is just a suggestion and the time it takes to find a actual block could be significantly less or more than this number. <br><br>
						<div id="currenteffort"><strong>What is current effort?</strong></div>
						Based upon the average time it takes us to find a block this is how far along we are in that timeframe as a percentage. Anything less than 100% is desirable and over that is less so. <br><br>
						<div id="maturityreq"><strong>What is maturity requirement?</strong></div>
						This is the number of blocks the network takes to verify a new block, or a transaction. Once our pool finds a block it will count down the number of blocks required to verify that this block does indeed belong to our pool. After this "maturity requirement" is up we distribute the block reward as a percentage of shares sent during that block round to the miners who sent them. <br><br>
						<div id="rewardsystem"><strong>What kind of reward system is this?</strong></div>
						You get a portion of the block reward based upon your share of hashes submitted during that round. If you were to send 50% of all hashes during a round you would receive 50% of the reward. Of course if you are of the pool hopping kind you will notice that the pool will drop your reward like the fucking roach infested sack of shit you are for being a pool hopper. How does that work? We favor hashes submitted closer to the reward time as apposed to further away, if you continue to mine during a round your reward will be the exact proportion you sent, but if you decided to duck out on a difficult block your reward will be less than that because you're a piece of shit and don't deserve to be rewarded. You can read all about this reward system <a href="https://slushpool.com/help/manual/rewards">here</a>.<br><br>
						<div id="banned"><strong>I got banned, what do I do?</strong></div>
						Fix your shit, the ban will expire in 10min. If you have already fixed your shit then take that time to contemplate the reason why you were banned. Go read reddit for a bit, fap... whatever you do just don't ask us to clear the ban for you because it's not going to happen. We might like you, you might even be a personal friend, but we don't manually clear bans for anyone. If you can't figure out why you were banned after checking your config you can always get ahold of us on discord and we can check the log files for the reason. We will probably give you some shit for it as well, but just know we have banned ourselves from our own pools so don't feel bad about it. <br><br>
						<div id="megabanned"><strong>I got mega banned like I can't even connect to you anymore, what do I do?</strong></div>
						You probably tripped our firewall and that will result in a 10min cool down as well. This is a bit more serious than say sending bad hashes because you picked the wrong algo. If you are sending anything that can be perceived as an attack, flood, exploit, etc. You will be banned at the router level and our pools won't even know you exist. If this happens you might want to get ahold of us on discord and we can figure out what is causing the mega ban. <br><br>
						<div id="wronghashrate"><strong>My hash-rate is different on the poolUI than on my miner?</strong></div>
						Yup and it always will be. The pool is calculating the hashes we accept and your miner is calculating it's own whatever it does. This will certainly never be the same, but if it's really far apart we might need you to set a higher difficulty. Also it takes time for the pool to determine your hash rate so if you just started mining on the pool you should check back in a hour or so. Crypto mining isn't a sprint baby, it's a god damn marathon so buckle the fuck up!<br><br>
						<div id="somethingwrong"><strong>Something is wrong, what do I do?</strong></div>
						Call the cops man! No really if you suspect something is amiss with our pool, say payments are not being sent, or there is a giant dick pick instead of a pool page. Get on discord and give us a mention. We are friendly folks we won't bite your head off. We might even send you a reward for helping us keep a eye on the network! If something else is wrong that's not related to our services then go ahead and call the cops. <br><br>
						<div id="featurerequest"><strong>I have a request for a feature, service, etc?</strong></div>
						We love requests, seriously we want to know what you guys want from us. If we can do it we will. So if you have something you want to see happen jump into discord and say it. We will evaluate the request, and act accordingly. If we decide to not implement your request we will let you know why, and if we do we will give you credit for the idea. <br><br>
						<div id="howmerged"><strong>How did you get merged mining to work?</strong></div>
						We asked a bunch of stupid questions and didn't fear the response when it came back. If you are a pool operator and have questions about pool operations we are more than willing to answer what we can. We won't share any code because that's not helping anyone learn anything, but we will answer questions as best we can.<br><br>
